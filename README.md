# TypeScript Advanced Concepts – 06 to 11

This repository is a collection of advanced TypeScript concepts and examples, designed to help developers prepare for technical interviews and improve practical TypeScript skills.

## Purpose

- Learn and practice **Discriminated Unions**, **Never Type**, **Union & Intersection Types**, **Type Guards**, **Infer Keyword**, and **Template Literal Types**.
- Provide **practical examples** that can be applied in real-world projects.
- Prepare for **interview questions** on advanced TypeScript topics.

## Topics Covered

1. **Discriminated Unions** – Creating distinct unions and exhaustive type handling.
2. **Never Type** – Functions that never return, exhaustiveness checks, and impossible types.
3. **Union & Intersection Types** – Combining types safely and expressing flexible type relationships.
4. **Type Guards** – Narrowing types at runtime using `typeof`, `instanceof`, `in`, and custom predicates.
5. **Infer Keyword** – Extracting types dynamically in advanced type transformations.
6. **Template Literal Types** – Creating dynamic string types and remapping object keys.

## Usage

- Study the examples to understand **how each TypeScript feature works**.
- Use the repository to **practice coding exercises** and **prepare for interviews**.
- Extend the examples to **real projects** for stronger mastery of TypeScript.
